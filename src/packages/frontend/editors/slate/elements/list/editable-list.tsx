      This is a weird case, but if you put an enumerated list that starts
      with anything except 1 inside of another list without a leading newline,
      then it breaks.  It works fine with 1.  Several markdown parsers do
      this, so whatever.  Note that this makes it impossible to have an
      ordered list nested inside a tight list if the numeration starts at
      a value other than 1.  Again, this is the way it is.  (Note: This sort
      of looks like it works without the newline but that's because of breaks=true.)
      Example -- the following does not work right, but if you change "2. xyz"
      to "1. xyz" then it does.

1. abc
   2. xyz
   3. foo
2. xyz

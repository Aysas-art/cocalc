          Finish your process by submitting your question to ChatGPT. In a few
          seconds, the AI will answer in a chatroom that appears off to the
          right. If the result is useful, you can then copy and paste it back
          into your document, or ask follow-up questions to refine your results.
          This will help you get unstuck, complete your projects and homework
          with ease, and increase your productivity.

Purchases

NOTES:


- cost is by definition how much the thing costs the customer, e.g., -10 means a credit of $10.
- amount is by definition the negative of cost.

We typically *show* user the amount, but we do absolutely all internal accounting
and storage with cost.  Why? Because I wrote all the code and tests that way, and it was
too late to change t use amount internally.  That's the only reason.

Table for tracking events related to a particular
account which help us optimize for growth.
Example entry;
 account_id: 'some uuid'
 time: a timestamp
 key: 'sign_up_how_find_cocalc'
 value: 'via a google search'

Or if user got to cocalc via a chat mention link:

 account_id: 'some uuid'
 time: a timestamp
 key: 'mention'
 value: 'url of a chat file'

The user cannot read or write directly to this table.
Writes are done via an API call, which (in theory can)
enforces some limit (to avoid abuse) at some point...

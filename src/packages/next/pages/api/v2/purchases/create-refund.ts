/*
Refund a transaction.

This is ONLY allowed for admins to refund some or all of a credit that was
created by any users.  Users can't directly get refunds -- they must
go through support, in order to avoid abuse.

This API creates a refund object in stripe *and* creates a new transaction
(entry in our purchases table) for that refund, reducing the amount of the
customer's balance.  It's possible it could reduce a balance below 0, in which
case the customer would have to add significant money before making a purchase.

We may create another different admin API call for canceling/refunding internal
transactions, if that turns out to be necessary.

- purchase_id - id of some purchase in the purchases table, so a positive integer
- reason -  "duplicate", "fraudulent", "requested_by_customer" or "other" (same as in stripe)
- admount - positive floating point number in *dollars* (NOT cents like in stripe)
- notes - optional string; user DOES see this.

I do different things with CoCalc.
Right now, I am editing a shared LaTeX document which is a math paper.

I also use it for simple calculations with rational functions, which I would screw up if I did them by hand.
Recently I used it as a convenient interface to Macauay2, which it is great for since I can never figure out how Macaulay2's interface is supposed to work.

All that to say, I feel like I am using only a tiny fraction of the power of CoCalc, but it is making my life easier, and I am grateful for it.`,

CoCalc has provided me with a stable, fully equipped, environment in which I've been able to build my programming skills and develop some worthwhile programs for my mathematics community – all for the cost of a cup of coffee each month.  It's been a tremendously valuable resource for me.`,

I just found out that my CoCalc class got by far the best course evaluations for any course I've taught at UCSD to date (over 85% on the favorable/unfavorable scale), which makes it a sure thing that I'll be teaching this course again (in some form) next year! Many thanks for the backend work on CoCalc, for the course materials, for the guest lecture...`,

CoCalc provides a user-friendly interface.
Students don't need to install any software at all.
They just open up a web browser and go to cocalc.com and that's it.

They just type code directly in, hit shift+enter and it runs, and they can see if it works.
It provides immediate feedback.
The course management features work really well.`,

Amazing!  Now a chemistry nerd like me can do some pretty fancy things
without having to also become a computer scientist.
And share those things with those even less computer-programmy than myself.
So that chemistry advances without “getting lost in the weeds”.

Time travel !!! wow !! I love that.  (I could have used that many many times.  Haha).

I was pretty sad when mybinder stopped working. [...] I know that CoCalc will be a new and improved replacement for mybinder.  And does not seem like a steep learning curve at all.

The documentation (and support!) is fabulous !!`,

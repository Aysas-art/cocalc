/*
Stripe Synchronization

ALMOST DEPRECATED -- only used/matters for users with legacy upgrade subscriptions
AND is used to change the email address/name of a user in stripe, when they change
it in cocalc... which is kind of weird to be here.

Get all info about the given account from stripe and put it in our own local
database. Also, call it right after the user does some action that will change
their account info status. Additionally, it checks the email address Stripe
knows about the customer and updates it if it changes.

This will not touch stripe if the user doesn't have a stripe_customer_id
set in the accounts table and customer_id is not given as an input.

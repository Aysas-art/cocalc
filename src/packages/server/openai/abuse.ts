/*
We initially just implement some very simple rate limitations to prevent very
blatant abuse.

- at most $5*10^4$ tokens per signed in user per hour \(that's \$0.10\); that allows for major usage...
  but if somebody tried to do something really abusive, it would stop it.  Nobody
  would hit this in practice unless they are really trying to abuse cocalc.
- at most $10^6$ tokens per hour across all users \-\- that's \$2/hour. That would
  come out to a bit more if sustained than my budget, but allows for bursts.

See https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7039783-chatgpt-api-faq for the upstream rate limits,
where they limit per minute, not per hour (like below):

    What's the rate limits for the ChatGPT API?

    Free trial users: 20 RPM 40000 TPM
    Pay-as-you-go users (first 48 hours): 60 RPM 60000 TPM
    Pay-as-you-go users (after 48 hours): 3500 RPM 90000 TPM

    RPM = requests per minute
    TPM = tokens per minute

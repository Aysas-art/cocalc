  We have all outstanding purchase info and server info. With that we should know
  exactly what to do.  NOTE: I'm not outlining anything here relateed to the database
  being corrupt due to race conditions or whatever, since I've setup the code
  so there shouldn't be any race conditions.

  NOTES:
  - Google charges us from when a server starts starting until it is stopped, i.e., for
    the startup time and shutdown time.  There's probably some very good reasons for that,
    e.g., some bigger servers can take minutes to start... but also if a user starts and
    stops immediately a bunch of machines, they can't cause a lot of charges.   We don't really do the same...
  - Google has a minimum of 1 minute.  We will for the same reasons.

  RULES:

  - RULE 1: If there are no compute-server purchases and the machine is currently not in
    the deprovisioned state, we start a compute-server purchase:
      - if state is stable, make it for that state
      - if state is unstable, make purchase for the target stable state

  - RULE 2: If there are no 'compute-server-network-usage' purchases and machine is
    running or starting, create such a purchase.

  - RULE 3: If there is a compute-server purchase and machine is in a stable state that is different
    from the purchase one (e.g., running vs off), end the current purchase.  If not deprovisioned,
    do a recursive call to create new purchase for new state.

  - RULE 4: If there is an ongoing 'compute-server-network-usage' purchase, possibly update it.
    If project is not running and it has been at least X minutes after stopping/deleting,
    update and close the purchase.  The issue here is just that network usage takes a few minutes to
    get recorded.

  - RULE 5: If the total duration of a purchase exceeds MAX_PURCHASE_INTERVAL_MS
    (e.g., 1 day), then we end that purchase and start another.

  - RULE 6: Balance actions -- **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED ONLY**
       - If balance is low, email user suggesting they add credit to their account
         or enable automatic billing.
       - If balance is lower, use automatic billing if possible (in no way implemented yet).
         If not, stop any running compute servers.
       - If balance drops too low, deprovision everything.

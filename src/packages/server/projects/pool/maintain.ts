/*
maintainNewProjectPool

This ensures that all projects in the pool are touched periodically,
i.e., running and not about to idle timeout.

The definition of "in the pool" is that the project is (1) not deleted, (2) has a null "users" field,
and (3) last_edited is recent to avoid stale old projects with an old image, etc.
This is a quick query due to indexes.

This also creates new projects to ensure there are enough in the pool.

NOTE: Race condition -- if multiple hubs simultaneously create projects, this at once it would at worst
result in the pool being temporarily too big.

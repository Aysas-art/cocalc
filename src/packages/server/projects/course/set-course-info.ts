/*
Set the course info about a student project.

This is the course field in the projects table.

For security reasons, this function does a lot more than
just set the course field as requested:

- If the account_id requesting the change is not a collaborator on
course.project_id, for the current value of the course field, then
the request is rejected.   This is because the teacher and TA's
are the collaborators on course.project_id, and only they should
be able to change the course field.

- If the payInfo field is different than the current course.payInfo
field (ignoring the cost fields for comparison), then we compute
and fill in the cost.  This is used to lock in the purchase price
when the instructor decides on what license the students should buy.
It would be unfair to increase their price.

- If course.paid field is set currently in the database, then it is
always maintained, rather than just being deleted.

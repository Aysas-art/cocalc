Sync remote stripe view of with our local view (in our database).

ALMOST DEPRECATED - THIS EXISTS ONLY TO SUPPORT THE LEGACY UPGRADE SUBSCRIPTIONS.

We only sync customers that currently have stripe_customer non-null and
were active in the last month.

And if ever a customer doesn't have any legacy upgrade subscriptions,
then we set stripe_customer to null so that we never consider them again.
